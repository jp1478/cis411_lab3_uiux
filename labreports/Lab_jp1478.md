## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 19 |  |
| LinkedIn | Score 2 | Summary 2 |

## 2.2 Indeed
![Indeed Profile](Indeed1.jpg)  
Indeed has a simple, understandable design, and I was easily able to update my resume. 

![Indeed Search](Indeed2.jpg)  
Indeed provides a wide variety of conditions to help narrow down your search. It has an application page if compatible, 
and a link to the company's site otherwise. 

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | The site is very intuitive, without any excessive details.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | The list of jobs required a lot of scrolling to view much of, but otherwise it is rather straightforward. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | Important buttons were large and colorful, but job descriptions required some scrolling to reach. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | The site made it easy to find what you were looking for and take action. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | Headings and directives are brief and clear. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | There is a small but comprehensive amount of navigation options.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | The site is compatible with chrome's screen reader extension and tab/touch selection. |
| **TOTAL** | 19 |   |

## 2.3 LinkedIn
![LinkedIn Profile](LinkedIn1.jpg)  
LinkedIn has a long profile page where you have to scroll to see most of the relevant information. 
Many of the buttons have unclear labels, making it difficult to navigate. 
I was able to update the banner of my profile easily. 

![LinkedIn Search](LinkedIn2.jpg)
The search page has a very granular filter system, but it is difficult to use. 
I was unable to give a location, so I got results from all over the country.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 1 | The button labels do not make sense and the navigation is complicated. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | The apply button is noticeable and allows you to immediately send your resume. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 1 | It is not immediately obvious where the job listings are, and there are many details in the margins that crowd out the main content. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | Once I made it to the job search page, it was difficult to find relevant information. It was easy to see how to apply, though. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? |   |   |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? |   |   |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? |   |   |
| **TOTAL** |   |   |
